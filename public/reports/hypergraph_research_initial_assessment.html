This suggests a relatively unexplored area with potential for innovation.</p><p>Further investigation is required to assess the feasibility and benefits of incorporating hypergraph structures into the MemoryKeep architecture.</p></body></html>

Now, to broaden the search and look for research on hypergraphs in *related* fields, such as biological neural networks and complex systems modeling. Perhaps insights from those areas can be applied to AI memory.
